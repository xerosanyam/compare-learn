# Non Functional Requirements

- many of them https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes
- we focus on popular ones

## High availability

- uptime (system has been working and available)
- count based
  - success ratio of requests
- it may happen that there was network outage and client couldn't reach server, even though server was available. therefore perspective matters and we should care about client's experience as system engineer

- involves both architecture (design concepts) and process (how we deploy etc)

### Steps

- build redundancy to avoid single point of failure (regions, availability zones, replication)
- switch from 1 server to another without losing data (DNS, load balancer, reverse proxy)
- protect from client (load shedding, rate limiting)
- protect from failure and perf degradation of dependencies (timeout, circuit breaker)
- detect failure (monitoring, health checks)

#### processes

- change management (changes should be reviwed and approved)
- QA (tests to validate newly introduced changes work)
- deployment pipeline (deploy to prod, automated rollback)
- capacity planning (monitoring system resources for growing demand)
- disaster recovery (backup, restore)
- root cause analysis
- game day (simulate a failure & test system and team response)
- team culture

- Dynamo DB gives 99.9999% availability
