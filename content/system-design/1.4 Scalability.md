# Scalability

- the property of a system to handle growing load
- load could be:
  1.  requests per second
  2.  volume of data
  3.  number of concurrent connections

# vertical vs horizontal

## vertical

- add resources to system
- after a point, it becomes expensive

## horizontal

- add more systems

### designing horizontal scalability

- harder

1. Service Discovery

- clients have to discover service machines

2. Load Balancing
3. Request Routing
4. Maintenace

## horizontal scaling for DB

- sharding to scale writes
- replication to scale reads

## how to get availability in a single machine

- active-passive setup
