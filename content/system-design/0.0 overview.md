# Overview

- master key design concepts
- Every system is unique, and the larger and more complex the system, the further it is from conventional design approaches, but in an interview you are expected to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of widely used system design concepts and best practices
- engineers are paid big money to come up with secret sauce to solve unique problems -> so don't worry about coming up with a unique solution
- you'll learn how to build a reliable, scalable, secure, fast, easy-to-maintain, and low-dollar-cost system

- youtube is a collection of small systems

## Thought process:

- break problem into common subproblems, then apply fundamental concepts & best practices to solve them

## problems to think about

- how to transfer data at large scale
- how to aggregate data efficiently
- how to store data reliably
- how to retrieve data quickly

## need to learn

- what common system design problems exists
- what tools we have to solve them

- think in LEGO model. each brick is a system design model
