# Functional Requirements

- need to identify _who_ is going to use system and _how_

- generally written in form of user stories
- when a user does this, system does that

  - user could be creator/ viewer (in youtube) or other systems (rate limiting system)

- easier to identify for systems we know (youtube, facebook, etc)
- harder to identify for systems we don't interact with generally (rate limiting systems, fraud prevention, CDN, etc)

## expectation:

- the interviewer wants to see how we deal with ambiguity
- also how we analyze big obscure problems & how we reduce compexity
- expect lot more ambiguity for senior roles

## action:

- start with customer and work backwards (amazon's approach)
