# Reliability

- Error: mistake, usually made by people
- Fault: a bug caused by error

- Fault tolerance:

  - goal is zero downtime
  - requires even more redundancy than high availability -> higher cost

- High availability:
  - goal is to minimize downtime

## Analogy:

- car vs airplane; in case of care easier to change the tire
- in case of engine failure in airplane; other engines have to take over (atleast till the nearest airport)
- car -> high availability. airplane -> fault tolerant

- Resilience:

  - in case of fault, maintain acceptable level of service

- Game Day

  - more focused on teams and its actions
  - goal is to build muscle memory on how to response to events

- choas engineering

  - more focused on systems behavior

- Reliability = Availability + Correctness + time (system replies in timely manner)

- reliability, high availability -> how system works in expected failures
- fault tolerance, resilience -> how system works in unexpected failures
