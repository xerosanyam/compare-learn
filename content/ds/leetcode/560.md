# subarray sum equals k

## brute force

- find all subarrays starting at 0, then 1, then 2

## using prefix sum

- we don't need curr and can calculate sum of subarray
  but how do reduce time complexity?

## prefix sum nuance

- if sum is same at two indices, then sum of subarray between them is 0

3, 2, -1, -2, 3
3, 5, 4, 2, 5
