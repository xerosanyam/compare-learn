# Framework

1.  First, we need to decide what the function is returning.
2.  Second, we need to decide on what arguments the function should take (state variables).

- Which is the recurrence relation of this problem. Typically, finding the recurrence relation is the hardest part of constructing a DP algorithm. This one is relatively straightforward, but we'll see later that recurrence relations can be much more complicated.

- The recurrence relation is useless on its own
- We need base cases so that our function eventually returns actual values.

- Figuring out the base cases is usually pretty easy and just requires a little bit of logical thinking. Make sure to read every question carefully.
