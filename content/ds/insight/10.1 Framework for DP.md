# Framework to solve DP problems

- 3 steps method
- we have taken example of [min-cost of climbing stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/)

1. a function or data structure that will compute/contain the answer to the problem for a given state

   1. Ex, for top down, we need to decide what the function is returning.
   2. Second, we need to decide on what arguments the function should take (state variables).

   - example: dp(i) -> min cost to reach stairs till i step

2. A recurrence relation to transition b/w states

- example: dp(100) = min(dp(99) + cost[99], dp(98) + cost[98])

- This is the recurrence relation of this problem. Typically, finding the recurrence relation is the hardest part of constructing a DP algorithm. This one is relatively straightforward, but we'll see later that recurrence relations can be much more complicated.

3. base cases

- By itself, the recurrence relation will continue forever until dp(-infinity).
- The recurrence relation is useless on its own
- We need base cases so that our function eventually returns actual values.

- Figuring out the base cases is usually pretty easy and just requires a little bit of logical thinking. Make sure to read every question carefully.
