# Linked List

- generally linkedlist is given as input
- there are few problems that will use LL to optimise the solution
- add or delete element at any position in O(1); caveate is you should have reference; else its O(n)
- much better than dynamic array which requries O(n) for add/delete at any position
- disadvantage - no random access
- more overhead than array

## traversal

```
let getSum = head => {
    let ans = 0;
    while (head) {
        ans += head.val;
        head = head.next;
    }

    return ans;
}
```

## insert

```
let addNode = (prevNode, nodeToAdd) => {
    nodeToAdd.next = prevNode.next;
    prevNode.next = nodeToAdd;
}


let deleteNode = prevNode => {
    prevNode.next = prevNode.next.next;
}
```

## doubly linked list

```
let addNode = (node, nodeToAdd) => {
    let prevNode = node.prev;
    nodeToAdd.next = node;
    nodeToAdd.prev = prevNode;
    prevNode.next = nodeToAdd;
    node.prev = nodeToAdd;
}

let deleteNode = node => {
    let prevNode = node.prev;
    let nextNode = node.next;
    prevNode.next = nextNode;
    nextNode.prev = prevNode;
}
```
