# Stack

- The characteristic that makes something a "stack" is that you can only add and remove elements from the same end
- For algorithm problems, a stack is a good option whenever you can recognize the LIFO pattern. Usually, there will be some component of the problem that involves elements in the input interacting with each other. Interacting could mean matching elements together, querying some property such as "how far is the next largest element", evaluating a mathematical equation given as a string, just comparing elements against each other, or any other abstract interaction. Sometimes, the LIFO property is hard to see, but we'll make sure to talk about how we recognize it in this chapter.
