# fast and slow pointers

- similar to 2 pointer technique
- break the problem down into steps

```
function fn(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head

    while fast and fast.next:
        Do something here
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
```

## variables

- slow, fast
- prev, curr, temp (in case of reversal)
