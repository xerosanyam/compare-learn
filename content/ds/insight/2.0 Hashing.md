# Hashing (using Map and Set)

## Data Structures

- 2 things to take care of in data structures- interface & implementation
- extremely common. reduces time complexity by O(n)
- modulo operation. if `num%x`; final value will be b/w `[0, x-1]`
- hash function -> converts key to index. array has index
- hash function + array = hashmap (hashtable / dictionary)
- hashmap -> maps key to value
- unordered, can add/remove in O(1)
- multiple ways to handle collision; most common is chaining
- how to reduce collison? size of array and modulus should be prime number

## Set

- when you want to just check if element exists
- hashes key to integer
- diff b/w set and hashamp is set has no value
- don't track frequency; add same element 100 times, it will still have 1

### hashmap in JS

```
let map = new Map();
map.set('a', 1);
map.get('a'); // 1
map.has('a'); // true
map.size; // 1
map.delete('a');
```

```
let set = new Set();
set.add('a');
set.has('a'); // true
set.size; // 1
set.delete('a');
```

#### key difference

```
set -> add
map -> set
```

## nuances

- string? -> make use of fact that there are only 26 alphabets
- nums? sum of nums, xor of nums
