# Hashing

## Data Structures

- interface & implementation
- extremely common. reduces time complexity by O(n)
- modulo operation. if num%x; final value will be b/w `[0, x-1]`
- hash function -> converts key to index. array has index
- hash function + array = hashtable / hashmap / dictionary
- hashmap -> map key to value
- unordered, can add/remove in O(1)
- multiple ways to handle collision; most common is chaining
- how to reduce collison? size of array and modulus should be prime number

## Set

- when you want to just check if element exists
- hashes key to integer
- diff b/w set and hashamp is set has no value
- don't track frequency; add same element 100 times, it will still have 1
