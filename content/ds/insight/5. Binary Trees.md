# Binary trees

- most common type of interview question
- makes heavy use of recursion
- LL and tree are types of graph
- real life examples:

  - file systems
  - comment thread
  - company hierarchy

- depth of tree: how far from root; root has depth 0

- when traveling LL we usually do it iteratively. with tree we usually do it recursively

## DFS

- preorder, postorder, inorder
- priortize depth

```
let dfs = node => {
    if (!node) {
        return;
    }

    dfs(node.left);
    dfs(node.right);
    return;
}
```

- each function call solves and returns the answer to the original problem as if the subtree rooted at the current node was the input
- preorder: root, left, right
  - logic is done first then move to children
- inorder: left, root, right
  - no logic is done until you reach a node without left child; since calling on left takes priority
- postorder: left, right, root
  - no logic until you reach leaf node; since calling on children takes priority; root is last
- The name of each traversal is describing when the current node's logic is performed.
  - pre: before children
  - in: between children
  - post: after children
- switching b/w 3 types is trivial, but you need to know which one to use when

- to calculate depth - you use postorder

## time & space complexity

- time: O(n) (you need to visit each node once)
- space:
  - worst - O(n) - tree can be straight line
  - best - O(log n) - balanced tree
