## 1.2 Sliding Window üñºÔ∏è

- window that can expand or contract
- uses
  - to find optimal subset of contiguous items

### concepts

- constraint metric (some attribute of subarray); sum of subarray
- numeric restriction; sum of subarray should be 7
- it grows as large as it can, then it shrinks
- works because input only has positive integers

### nuances

- left can be greater than right, but only by 1 position. in that case (right - left + 1) ie, (0 - 1 + 1) = 0

### visualization

- a crab ü¶Ä
- moves in single direction (outer for loop)
- its legs expand or contract based on condition (inner while loop)
- crab moves right, it ingests what it finds, now it checks whether it needs to excrete something or it can keep in tummy
- 2 loops give us 2 degree of freedom

```
function fn(arr):
    left = 0
    for (int right = 0; right < arr.length; right++):
        Do some logic to "add" element at arr[right] to window

        while WINDOW_IS_INVALID:
            Do some logic to "remove" element at arr[left] from window
            left++

        Do some logic to update the answer
```

### why is it efficient

- sub arrays can be of length n, n-1, n-2; therefore comparisons would create O(n^2) solution. but because of sliding window O(n).
- the outer loop runs O(n), the inner loop runs O(n) -> but the amortized cost of inner loop is O(1);

  even though the worst case for an iteration inside the for loop is ùëÇ(ùëõ) it averages out to O(1) when you consider the entire runtime of the algorithm

  - this shows nested loop doesn't direclty imply O(n^2)

- If the while loop were to run n times on one iteration of the for loop, that would mean it wouldn't run at all for all the other iterations of the for loop. This is what we refer to as amortized analysis - even though the worst case for an iteration inside the for loop is O(n), it averages out to O(1) when you consider the entire runtime of the algorithm.

### variations

- calculate num of subarray-> when right is fixed, the number of subarray is actually size of window; so calculation is easier; at each iteration of outerloop, the num of subarray can be size of window

### Fixed window

```
function fn(arr, k):
    curr = some data to track the window

    // build the first window
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
        Do something with curr or other variables to build first window

    ans = answer variable, probably equal to curr here depending on the problem
    for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++)
        Add arr[i] to window
        Remove arr[i - k] from window
        Update ans

    return ans
```
