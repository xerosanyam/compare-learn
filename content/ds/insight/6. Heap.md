# Heap

- priority queue is an abstract data structure
- add an element in O(log n) time
- remove an element in O(log n) time
- get the maximum element in O(1) time

- The ability to find the max/min element in constant time, while only needing logarithmic time to maintain this ability through changes makes a heap an extremely powerful data structure.

## implementation

- There are multiple ways to implement a heap, although the most popular way is called a binary heap using an array.

- If a node is at index i, then its children are at indices 2i + 1 and 2i + 2. When elements are added or removed, operations are done to maintain the aforementioned property of parent.val <= child.val. The number of operations needed scales logarithmically with the number of elements in the heap, and the process is known as "bubbling up".

- A heap is a great option whenever you need to find the maximum or minimum of something repeatedly.

## 2 heaps

- Using multiple heaps is uncommon and the problems that require it are generally on the harder side. If a problem involves finding a median, it's a good thing to think about
