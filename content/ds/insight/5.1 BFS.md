# BFS

- DFS uses stack (recursion is stack), BFS uses iteration and queue

## when to use BFS vs DFS

- if you have to visit every node then it doesn't matter
- its rare to find problem that using DFS is better than BFS
- implementing DFS is usually less code and easier because of recursion
  - so generally people end up using DFS
- on flip side, there are few problems where BFS makes more sense (generally when dealing with level)

- in some cases, solution might be in Right tree, and if u had used DFS, you will waste time visiting all left nodes
- in some cases, solution might be in last level, and if u had used BFS, you will waste time visiting all levels

- space complexity in DFS is height of tree
- space complexity in BFS is width of tree
- in some cases, DFS will use less space, in some BFS

- perfect tree - BFS uses more space O(n), DFS uses less space O(log n)
- lopsided tree - DFS uses more space O(n), BFS uses less space (O(1))

```js
let printAllNodes = (root) => {
  let queue = [root]
  while (queue.length) {
    let nextQueue = []

    for (let i = 0; i < queue; i++) {
      let node = queue[i]

      // do some logic here on the current node
      console.log(node.val)

      // put the next level onto the queue
      if (node.left) {
        nextQueue.push(node.left)
      }
      if (node.right) {
        nextQueue.push(node.right)
      }
    }

    queue = nextQueue
  }
}
```

- shift is way slower than pop (atleast 2x)
