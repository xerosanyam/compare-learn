## For vs While

- I used to think its mostly same; but its important to understand the nuance b/w the 2 to solve DSA problems
- for - rigid; while - free flowing

### visualization

#### for

- works like stair; you start from bottom; you step up; you have fixed length
- nature - pulsating & rythmic like wall clock

#### while

- works like rolling a dice; wait until condition is met or continue throwing until a condition is met
