# common patterns

- create string in js using char array and then performing join

## subarray/substring

- sliding window

## prefix

- input is integer array and you need to find sum of subarray

## subsequence

- slightly more difficult than subarray
- sliding window is not applicable
- more in dynamic programming

## subset

- order doesn't matter, also don't need to be adjacent
- ex: `[1,2,3,4]`; subset are `[1,3] , [1], [3,2,1]`
- backtracking
- easier than subsequence, because order doesn't matter
- you can sort the input, because order doesn't matter
