# common patterns

## subarray vs subsquence vs subset

- subarray: contiguous elements
- subsequence: not necessarily contiguous
- subset: not necessarily contiguous, order doesn't matter

## solving problems

- subarray: sliding window, prefix sum (input is integer array and you need to find sum of subarray)
- subsequence: dynamic programming
- subset: backtracking, you can sort the array because order doesn't matter

## nature of difficulty

- subarray: easy
- subsequence: medium
- subset: easy

## examples

`[1,2,3,4]`

- subarray: `[1,2]`, `[2,3,4]`
- subsequence: `[1,3]`, `[1]`, `[3,2,1]`
- subset: `[1,3]`, `[1]`, `[3,2,1]`
