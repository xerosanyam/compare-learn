# Monotonic

- elements are always sorted
- monotonic stack/queue, maintain their sorted propery by removing element that would violate the sorted property before adding new element

- useful in problems where you have to find the "next" greater/smaller element

```
stack = []
for num in nums:
    while stack.length > 0 AND stack.top >= num:
        stack.pop()
    // Between the above and below lines, do some logic depending on the problem
    stack.push(num)
```
