## Two Pointers Technique
```
function fn(arr):
    left = 0
    right = arr.length - 1

    while left < right:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        Do some more logic here to decide on one of the following:
            1. left++
            2. right--
            3. Both left++ and right--
```
- strength: we will never have more than O(n) iterations
- simple iteration; no recursion

### Two pointer - with multiple iterables

```
function fn(arr1, arr2):
    i = j = 0
    while i < arr1.length AND j < arr2.length:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        Do some more logic here to decide on one of the following:
            1. i++
            2. j++
            3. Both i++ and j++

    // Step 4: make sure both iterables are exhausted
    // Note that only one of these loops would run
    while i < arr1.length:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        i++

    while j < arr2.length:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        j++
```
- strength: will never have more than O(m+n) iterations

Variations:
- we started index at first & last. some problems might require starting at other index
- in 2nd case, we moved pointers on 2 different inputs; sometimes there will be only 1 input but we will still initialize both at 1st index & move both of them forward
