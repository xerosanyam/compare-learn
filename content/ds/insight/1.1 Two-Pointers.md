## Two Pointers Technique ðŸ”„

### intro

- very common, used to solve array/string problems
- pointers - 2
- iterables - 1 or 2

### variation 1: 1 iterable

```
function fn(arr):
    left = 0
    right = arr.length - 1

    while left < right:
        // Do some logic here depending on the problem
        // Do some more logic here to decide on one of the following:
            1. left++
            2. right--
            3. Both left++ and right--
```

### strength:

- we will never have more than O(n) iterations

### uses:

- effective for comparing pair of elements
- finding subarray/substring, reversing array

### variation 2: 2 iterable

```
function fn(arr1, arr2):
    i = j = 0
    while i < arr1.length AND j < arr2.length:
        // Do some logic here depending on the problem
        // Do some more logic here to decide on one of the following:
            1. i++
            2. j++
            3. Both i++ and j++

    // Step 4: make sure both iterables are exhausted
    // Note that only one of these loops would run
    while i < arr1.length:
        // Do some logic here depending on the problem
        i++

    while j < arr2.length:
        // Do some logic here depending on the problem
        j++
```

### strength

- will never have more than O(m+n) iterations

### other variations

- in variation 1, we started index at first & last. some problems might require starting at other index
- in variation 2, we initialized pointers at 0 but ran on 2 different inputs; sometimes there will be only 1 input but we will still initialize both at 0th index & move both of them forward (2 pointer is just a technique)
