## Recursion
- there is a branch of study that proves any iterative algorithm can be written recursively
- uses functions to mimic loops
- needs a base condition (condition at start of recursive function that terminates the calls)
- use it to breakdown a problem into subproblem; whose solutions can then be combined to solve original problem
