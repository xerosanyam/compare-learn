## Recursion

- every recursive algorithm can be converted to iterative and vice-versa
- uses functions to mimic loops; use callstack to mimic queue
- needs a base condition (condition at start of recursive function that terminates the calls)
- use it to breakdown a problem into subproblem; whose solutions can then be combined to solve original problem
