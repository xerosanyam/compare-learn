## Big oh

- describes computational complexity of an algorithm
- split in 2 parts
	1. space - amount of memory allocated relative to input size
	2. time - amount of time relative to input size; how the num of operation changes respect to input changes

what is time complexity of following?
```
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (int j = i; j < arr.length; j++) {
        print(arr[i] + arr[j])
    }
}
```

<code>
O(n^2)
</code>

1. the inner loops run for n times
2. then for n-1, n-2
3. sum of n, n-1, n-2 is a series. n*(n+1)/2.

- O(1) - no matter input size, algorithm always uses constant time
- O(logn) - somewhere in algorithm, input is being reduced by percentage
