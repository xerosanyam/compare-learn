### Event Loop

First we need to understand

1. Call Stack
2. Web APIs (Browser) <-> C++ APIs (Node)
3. Callback Queue
   1. Micro Task Queue
   2. Macro Task Queue
4. Event Loop

- Job of event loop is very simple:

```js
if (stack.isEmpty) {
  if (!queue.isEmpty) {
    const item = queue.shift()
    stack.push(item)
  }
}
```

- Shouldn't block the event loop -> don't put blocking code on stack

- just spins round and round in a cpu efficient manner

### Working:

1. When we queue a task, event loop takes a detour
2. Tasks are added to queue, event loop picks a task, waits for it to finish, then picks a new task

#### Render Steps:

- to update what is on the screen

1. style calculation (CSS)
2. Layout - create render tree
3. actual pixel data - painting

if you want to do something before browser paints - `requestAnimationFrame`
if you want to do something after browser paints - nested `requestAnimationFrame`
