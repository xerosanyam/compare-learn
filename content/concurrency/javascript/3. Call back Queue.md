## Call back Queue / Task Queues

- Receive events from Web APIs
- oldest part of event loop

### 1. (Macro) Tasks

- take one item from queue
- if new item, push to queue
- example: setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate

### 2. Animation Callbacks - requestAnimationFrame

- process all elements in queue
- if new item push to new queue

### 3. Micro Tasks

<!-- - browser wanted to give developers a way to monitor DOM changes
- so they gave mutuations
  ```js
  document.body.addEventListener('DOMNodeInserted', () => {})
  ``` -->

- process all elements in queue
- if new item, push to same queue and process in same iteration
- example: process.nextTick, Promise, queueMicrotask
