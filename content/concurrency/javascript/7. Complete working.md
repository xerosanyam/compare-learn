## Complete Working

1. All functions in that are currently in the call stack get executed. When they returned a value, they get popped off the stack.
2. When the call stack is empty, all queued up microtasks are popped onto the callstack one by one, and get executed! (Microtasks themselves can also return new microtasks, effectively creating an infinite microtask loop ðŸ˜¬)
3. If both the call stack and microtask queue are empty, the event loop checks if there are tasks left on the (macro)task queue. The tasks get popped onto the callstack, executed, and popped off!
