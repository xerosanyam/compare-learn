### Why?
At its core, software development solves a problem or achieves a result with computation. The software development process first defines a problem, then presents a solution. Object oriented programming is one of several major approaches to the software development process.

The object structure makes it flexible within a program. Objects can transfer information by calling and passing data to another object's methods. Also, new classes can receive, or inherit, all the features from a base or parent class. This helps to reduce repeated code.
