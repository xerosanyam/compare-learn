### how is it different from imperative?
- in english, imperative tense means giving commands
- imperative programming means, giving computer set of statements to perfom task
  - often statements change state of prog, like updating global var
  - ex> for loop, that gives exact direction to iterate over indices of array
- functional programming is declarative form of programming
  - you tell computer what you want done by calling a method
  - ex> map() method that can iterate over array w/o worrying about indexes
> fp focuses on **what**. imperative focuses on **how**
